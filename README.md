# tsw-learn-css
small package for my clients to practice CSS

## Overview
Simple package of files to use as a learning tool so a person can start manipulating CSS

## Motivation
Too many times have I had to refer people to W3 pages or other similar sites in order to help them understand what Cascading Style Sheet was and how to get started using it. Mostly those who have WordPress sites and are not going to do any more than cahnge some title attributes or predefined classes.

## Installation
* file content only
* You will need to open the file in a text editor... NOT in Word, but an actual text editor. Then you make your changes and refresh the browser to see the results.
* More instructions in the demo.
